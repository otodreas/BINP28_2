## Running the script

My answers are in `todreas_genepred_quiz.sh`. Run the script to reveal all my answers in the terminal. Make sure you `cd` into the `gene_pred_lab` directory.

## If the script doesn't work

Try re-generating the data using the scripts in `utils/`. Note that you need to update `utils/get_intpu_file.sh` with your server address and you need to have prodigal installed.

If that doesn't work, the output that I generated from `todreas_genepred_quiz.sh` can be found in `todreas_genepred_quiz.txt`.

Please note that question 5 takes a few seconds to run, please be patient.
